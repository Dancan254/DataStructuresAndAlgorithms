## üß© Overview

This repository contains solutions and explanations for a variety of data structures and algorithms implemented in [your language(s)]. The goal is to provide clear, well-documented examples that can serve as a study guide, a coding reference, or a preparation resource for technical interviews.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

To run the code locally, clone this repository using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dancan254/DataStructuresAndAlgorithms.git
cd DataStructuresAndAlgorithms
```

If your code requires additional dependencies or a specific language environment, include instructions here for setup, like installing a language runtime or libraries.

## ‚è± Complexity Analysis

To better understand the efficiency of each data structure and algorithm, this repository includes complexity analysis tables, outlining the **Time Complexity** and **Space Complexity** of the major operations:

| Data Structure / Algorithm | Average Time Complexity | Worst Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|----------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|------------------|
| Array (Access)             | O(1)                   | O(1)                  | O(n)             |
| Linked List (Insert)       | O(1)                   | O(n)                  | O(n)             |
| Bubble Sort                | O(n^2)                 | O(n^2)                | O(1)             |
| Merge Sort                 | O(n log n)             | O(n log n)            | O(n)             |


## üìù How to Use

1. **Navigate**: Go to the folder of the data structure or algorithm you wish to study.
2. **Run the Code**: Each implementation has a test file or main method. Use this to run the code locally.
3. **Practice Problems**: Some folders contain additional problems related to each topic (e.g., LeetCode or HackerRank questions).
4. **Modify and Experiment**: Modify the code to better understand the inner workings or to solve custom problems.
