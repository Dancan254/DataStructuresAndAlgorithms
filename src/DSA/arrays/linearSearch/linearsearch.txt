Linear Search:
- Simple searching algorithm that sequentially checks each element in a list or array.
- Begins at the first element and compares it with the target value.
- Continues until the element is found or the end of the list is reached.
- Time complexity is O(n) where n is the number of elements in the list.
- Suitable for small lists or unsorted data, but inefficient for large datasets.
