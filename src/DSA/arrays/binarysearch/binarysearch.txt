Binary Search:
- Efficient search algorithm for sorted arrays or lists.
- Compares the target value to the middle element of the array.
- If the middle element is the target, the search is successful.
- If the target is less than the middle element, the search continues in the lower half; if greater, in the upper half.
- Repeatedly divides the search interval in half until the target is found or the interval is empty.
- Time complexity is O(log n) where n is the number of elements in the array.
- Well-suited for large datasets and provides a significant performance advantage over linear search.
