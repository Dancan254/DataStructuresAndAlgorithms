Sorting:
- Process of arranging elements in a specific order, such as numerical or lexicographical.
- Enables efficient searching, insertion, and retrieval of elements from a collection.
- Various sorting algorithms exist, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.
- Common sorting algorithms include Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort.
- The choice of sorting algorithm depends on factors such as the size of the dataset, the presence of duplicate elements, and the desired time and space complexity.
- Sorting algorithms can be categorized as comparison-based or non-comparison-based, depending on how they compare elements during the sorting process.
