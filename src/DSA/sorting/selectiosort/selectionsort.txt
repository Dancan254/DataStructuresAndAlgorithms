Selection Sort:
- A simple sorting algorithm that divides the input list into two sub-lists: the sublist of items already sorted and the sublist of items remaining to be sorted.
- In each iteration, the algorithm finds the minimum element from the unsorted sublist and swaps it with the first element of the unsorted portion,
  effectively expanding the sorted sublist by one element.
- The process continues until the entire array is sorted.
- Inefficient for large datasets, with a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst and average cases.
- Useful for educational purposes or small datasets due to its simplicity and ease of implementation.
