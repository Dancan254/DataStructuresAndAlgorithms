Bubble Sort:
- Simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- Passes through the list are repeated until the list is sorted.
- Inefficient for large datasets, with a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst and average cases.
- Useful for educational purposes or small datasets due to its simplicity.
